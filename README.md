### Hello!

I like to write code. I like to experiment with new things, or try to solve problems that annoy me and maybe no-one else. I have all sorts of cool ideas for things to build and sometimes I even start building them. I generally don't finish, once I've done the interesting bits that teach me something or prove that something can be done the grind of shipping isn't something I have much interest in doing in my spare time. But who knows, one day maybe I'll ship something!

Almost nothing I work on professionally is hosted on github so all you're seeing here are things I work on in my spare time.

I believe that the most impactful digital experiences arise from a harmonious blend of insightful design and skillful development. I'm passionate about translating user needs into elegant, functional, and visually captivating solutions using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **PHP**.

Not so long ago I found an archive of my old subversion server and so there are a whole bunch of my ancient projects up here. Don't judge the code too harshly, I'm sure your code wasn't fantastic 20 years ago!
